### MLOps Phases 1 & 2 - Chess Result Prediction Using PySpark

This repository demonstrates the application of MLOps practices to manage and operationalize a machine learning workflow for predicting chess game outcomes, with a strong focus on using PySpark for data processing and analysis.

**Phase 1: Data Preparation with PySpark**
1. PySpark Setup: Configures PySpark to handle large-scale data operations efficiently.
2. Data Loading and Processing: Uses PySpark to load, clean, and preprocess a comprehensive dataset of chess games. PySpark’s distributed data processing capabilities are utilized to manage large volumes of data, which are typical in real-world scenarios.
3. Feature Engineering: Implements feature transformations and engineering using PySpark’s DataFrame API to prepare the data for predictive modeling.
4. Data Storage: Leverages PySpark to store processed data in Parquet format, ensuring optimized storage and fast retrieval for machine learning operations.

**Phase 2: Model Training and Deployment with PySpark and MLflow**
1. Model Training: Employs PySpark’s MLlib to train a logistic regression model, taking advantage of its scalable machine learning algorithms.
2. Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model within the PySpark environment using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust performance.
3. MLflow Integration: Integrates MLflow for tracking experiments, logging parameters, and metrics directly from the PySpark environment, and manages models which include registering and deploying the models for production.
4. Deployment Readiness: Demonstrates how to prepare a PySpark-based ML model for deployment, emphasizing the transition from experimental to production environments.

**Tools and Technologies:**
1. Apache Spark and PySpark for scalable data processing and machine learning.
2. MLflow for experiment tracking, model logging, and deployment.

**Objective:**
To showcase how to effectively use PySpark in an MLOps framework to develop and manage machine learning models from the ground up, focusing on scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets typically associated with game analytics.
